# Introduction
We will work according to the document `tasks.md` (just in case you don't know!). 

Our team will set up this document (`README.md`), and include some data in it. We will also create a project board, with __Basic Kanban__ template, and set up automations to it. A code written in C will be created and also included in this document. Finally, we will promote our team's page!
